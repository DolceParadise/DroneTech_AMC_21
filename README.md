# DroneTech_AMC_21
Our submission for DroneTech, an event of Technex 2021. This code was supposed to be a controller for a Mavic Drone. This drone had the task to scan a QR code and a letter associated with it at every checkpoint. The QR code contained the coordinates of the next checkpoint and the letter was supposed to be stored in a two dimensional 3x3 array containing letters collected at each checkpoint. At the final checkpoint, there were four QR codes containing data of four words. We were supposed to run a crossword check on our gathered 3x3 matrix for each word. If a word of any of the four QR code was found in the search, we were supposed to land on that particular QR code. Our code was able to complete all the tasks. Do refer to Round-2.pdf for a detail of our tasks.
